On some level the history of philosophy is a history of attempting to understand alienation—it's something we all deal with and philosophers are human after all. As far back as Plato's cave allegory we see figures inside of a cave mistaking shadows on the wall for reality.

Many of us mellenials remember a time before computers. We used to have an oldschool phone in our home with a cord. I remember in Junior High I had a crush on some girl named Crystal and this one night she called me. I was so excited I stretched the phone as far as it could go around the corner and
