So, I made a new website and this one I kind of like.

My previous one wasn't much different—the main changes include mostly aesthetic and framework upgrades. Prior to this version I was drawn to the dark mode aesthetic so the background was dark with purple gradients. That site was built on Nuxt 3 with the Nuxt 4 features opt-in enabled.

Recently, however, I've been more interested in lighter colors. Perhaps it has something to do with the state of the world and the desire to surround myself with more light than dark (of course my code editor, phone, etc are still switched to dark mode). This new site also has a color mode switcher up top for those who feel like switching.

In terms of content I loaded more information into the main `index.vue` page, at least on desktop. The mobile version of the main `index.vue` page is more minimalist with 4 cards in a grid and it's not my favorite but it will do.

The main reasons for wanting to redo my site are twofold. Firstly, I genuinely enjoy building with Nuxt and praticting design so when Nuxt 4 launched I thought it would be a cool project. Secondly, I simply wasn't thrilled with the previous version. For example, the home page had an `H1` and a couple buttons—it looked cool and had a nice loading effect but it wasn't very functional (if you wanted to see me you had to click on about).

At the end of the day I just wanted something a little more friendly and functional. So there you have it.

## Tech Stack

Below is just a quick list of what was used for making this site. Basically, I just really enjoy building with Nuxt and use it on 90% of my projects. If you are interested in using Nuxt there's of course a huge community but you can also feel free to reach out to me as well.
